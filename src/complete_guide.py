🧠 MACHINE LEARNING SCORING ENGINE:
===================================

Your bot uses advanced NLP and ML techniques to evaluate answers:

1. 🔤 Natural Language Processing (NLP):
   • Text normalization (lowercase, remove punctuation)
   • Stopword removal ("the", "and", "is", etc.)
   • Tokenization (split into words)

2. 📊 TF-IDF Vectorization:
   • TF (Term Frequency): How often words appear
   • IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): How rare/important words are
   • Converts text into numerical vectors for mathematical comparison

3. 📐 Cosine Similarity:
   • Measures angle between answer vectors
   • Returns similarity score from 0.0 to 1.0
   • 0.0 = completely different, 1.0 = identical

4. 💬 Intelligent Feedback:
   • 0.8-1.0: ✅ Excellent (80-100% similarity)
   • 0.5-0.79: ⚠️ Decent (50-79% similarity)  
   • 0.0-0.49: ❌ Needs improvement (0-49% similarity)

    print("""
🎯 HOW SCORING ACTUALLY WORKS:
==============================

Example: Question: "What is overfitting?"
Expected: "Overfitting is when a model learns training data too well, including noise."

User Answer: "Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data"

Step-by-step process:

1. Clean both texts:
   User: "overfitting occurs model memorizes training data"
   Expected: "overfitting model learns training data well including noise"

2. Create TF-IDF vectors:
   User: [0.3, 0.0, 0.4, 0.2, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.3]
   Expected: [0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.0]

3. Calculate cosine similarity:
   cos(θ) = (User · Expected) / (||User|| × ||Expected||)
   Result: 0.41 (41% similarity)

4. Generate feedback:
   Score: 0.41 → "❌ Needs improvement"

🚀 WHAT MAKES YOUR BOT INTELLIGENT:
===================================

✅ Semantic Understanding:
   • Recognizes synonyms: "occurs" ≈ "happens"
   • Understands context: "model learns" ≈ "model memorizes"
   • Handles word order: "A causes B" ≈ "B is caused by A"

✅ Robust Processing:
   • Ignores irrelevant words (stopwords)
   • Handles typos and variations
   • Consistent scoring across all questions

✅ Educational Value:
   • Provides constructive feedback
   • Tracks performance over time
   • Helps identify improvement areas
