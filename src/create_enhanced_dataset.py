        "What is PoS Tagging": "Part-of-Speech tagging assigns grammatical categories (noun, verb, adjective) to words in text.",
        "What is tokenization": "Tokenization splits text into individual words, phrases, or meaningful elements for processing.",
        "What is topic modeling": "Topic modeling discovers abstract topics in document collections using unsupervised learning methods.",
        "What is back propagation": "Backpropagation calculates gradients and updates neural network weights by propagating errors backward.",
        "What is the idea behind GANs": "GANs use two competing networks (generator vs discriminator) to create realistic synthetic data.",
        "What is the Computational Graph": "A computational graph represents operations as nodes and data flow as edges for efficient gradient computation.",
        "What is sigmoid What does it do": "Sigmoid activation function maps inputs to (0,1) range, useful for binary classification output layers."
