## 🧠 Understanding the Scoring System

Your Interview Coach Bot uses advanced Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to score your answers:

### How Scoring Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**: 
   - Converts to lowercase
   - Removes punctuation and stopwords
   - Tokenizes into individual words

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
   - Converts text to numerical vectors
   - Considers word frequency and importance

3. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - Calculates semantic similarity between your answer and expected answer
   - Returns score from 0.0 to 1.0

4. **Feedback Generation**:
   - **0.8 - 1.0**: ✅ Excellent (80-100% similarity)
   - **0.5 - 0.79**: ⚠️ Decent (50-79% similarity)
   - **0.0 - 0.49**: ❌ Needs improvement (0-49% similarity)

### Understanding Your Scores

```
Example: Question: "What is overfitting?"
Expected: "Overfitting is when a model learns training data too well, including noise."

✅ Good Answer (Score: 0.85):
"Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data and performs poorly on new data"
→ High keyword overlap + semantic similarity

⚠️ Average Answer (Score: 0.45):
"When machine learning model is too complex"
→ Some relevant terms but missing key concepts

❌ Poor Answer (Score: 0.12):
"I don't know much about this topic"
→ No relevant keywords or concepts
```

### Tips for Better Scores

- **Use technical keywords** relevant to the question
- **Provide detailed explanations** rather than one-word answers
- **Include examples** when possible
- **Cover multiple aspects** of the concept
- **Use proper terminology** for your field

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Questions

#### Method 1: Direct JSON Editing
Edit `data/questions_enhanced.json` to add new questions:

```json
{
  "Data Scientist": {
    "easy": [
      {
        "question": "What is feature engineering?",
        "answer": "Feature engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new features from raw data to improve machine learning model performance."
      }
    ],
    "medium": [
      {
        "question": "Explain the bias-variance tradeoff",
        "answer": "The bias-variance tradeoff describes the relationship between model complexity and generalization. High bias models are too simple and underfit, while high variance models are too complex and overfit."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Method 2: Using Kaggle Datasets
1. **Find datasets on Kaggle**:
   - Search for "interview questions [your domain]"
   - Download CSV files with questions and answers

2. **Use the dataset loader**:
   ```bash
   python src/kaggle_dataset_loader.py
   ```

3. **Convert to bot format**:
   ```bash
   python src/create_enhanced_dataset.py
   ```

### Adding New Job Roles

1. **Update questions database** (`data/questions_enhanced.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "Your New Role": {
       "easy": [
         {"question": "Basic question?", "answer": "Basic answer."}
       ],
       "medium": [
         {"question": "Medium question?", "answer": "Medium answer."}
       ],
       "hard": [
         {"question": "Hard question?", "answer": "Hard answer."}
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Update main.py** to include new role:
   ```python
   available_roles = ["Data Scientist", "ML Engineer", "Deep Learning Engineer", "Web Developer", "Your New Role"]
   ```

### Customizing Feedback Messages

Edit `src/resources.py` to customize feedback:

```python
def get_tip(score):
    if score >= 0.9:
        return "🎉 Outstanding! Perfect answer!"
    elif score >= 0.8:
        return "✅ Excellent! Your answer is very close to the ideal one."
    elif score >= 0.6:
        return "⚠️ Good attempt. Include more technical details."
    elif score >= 0.4:
        return "⚠️ Decent attempt. You covered some key points, but can elaborate more."
    else:
        return "❌ Needs improvement. Try to study the core concept and include relevant keywords."
```

### Adjusting Difficulty Levels

Modify difficulty assignment in `src/create_enhanced_dataset.py`:

```python
# Custom difficulty logic
if any(keyword in question.lower() for keyword in ['what is', 'define', 'basic']):
    difficulty = "easy"
elif any(keyword in question.lower() for keyword in ['compare', 'explain', 'describe']):
    difficulty = "medium"  
elif any(keyword in question.lower() for keyword in ['implement', 'design', 'optimize']):
    difficulty = "hard"
```

### Creating Custom Datasets

1. **Prepare your CSV file** with columns:
   - `question` or `DESCRIPTION`: The interview question
   - `answer` or `SOLUTION`: The expected answer
   - `difficulty` (optional): easy/medium/hard
   - `category` (optional): Job role category

2. **Use conversion script**:
   ```python
   # Modify src/create_enhanced_dataset.py
   csv_path = "path/to/your/dataset.csv"
   df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
   # Add your conversion logic
   ```

### Advanced Customization

#### Modify Scoring Algorithm
Edit `src/evaluator.py` to change how similarity is calculated:

```python
def evaluate_answer(user_answer, correct_answer):
    # Add custom preprocessing
    user_clean = custom_clean_text(user_answer)
    correct_clean = custom_clean_text(correct_answer)
    
    # Use different vectorization
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
        max_features=1000,  # Limit vocabulary
        ngram_range=(1, 2)  # Include bigrams
    )
    
    # Custom similarity calculation
    vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform([user_clean, correct_clean])
    score = cosine_similarity(vectors[0], vectors[1])[0][0]
    
    # Apply custom scoring weights
    return min(score * 1.1, 1.0)  # Boost scores slightly
```

#### Add New Evaluation Metrics
You can extend the system to include:
- **BLEU score** for translation-like evaluation
- **ROUGE score** for summarization tasks
- **Semantic similarity** using word embeddings
- **Keyword coverage** percentage

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **FileNotFoundError: questions.json not found**
```bash
Error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/questions.json'
```
**Solution**: Ensure you're running from the project root directory
```bash
cd interview-coach-bot
python src/main.py
```
